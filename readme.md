# MVPS
The code will be soon. This is the official repository of the paper "MVPS: Multi-View Adaptive Prompt Synergy for Zero-shot Industry Ano
maly Detection". The code of paper is in version "old-code-version". Please switch the branch. The latest version of code is more stable and more better than the old one. Maybe testing on VISA will be decreased but better on MVTEC. Noting that the setting of our experiment is using BatchSize 4 (~26G) and learning rate is 1e-4. The setting of experiment is important to the result. 
Methodology framework is provided in this repository, and the complete code will be made available in the future.
